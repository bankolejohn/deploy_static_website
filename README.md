## IMPROVEMENTS
So i have made some improvements to the task. 

### Automated Website Deployment with CI/CD Pipeline

This GitHub Actions workflow implements a robust Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipeline for your static website.

Key Features:

Automated Updates: Upon any push to the main branch, the workflow automatically triggers, streamlining the deployment process.
Streamlined Workflow: Manual updates to the S3 bucket are no longer necessary. Changes to your website's source code seamlessly synchronize with the S3 bucket, ensuring your website reflects the latest version.
Improved Efficiency: This automation saves time and effort, allowing you to focus on website development and maintenance tasks.

Benefits:

Reduced Errors: Manual updates are prone to human error. Automating deployment minimizes the risk of errors and inconsistencies.
Increased Reliability: Consistent and automated deployment ensures a reliable and up-to-date website experience for your users.
Faster Deployment: Updates are deployed swiftly, minimizing downtime and maintaining a smooth user experience.

This CI/CD pipeline empowers you to efficiently manage your website deployments and deliver the latest version to your users promptly.
